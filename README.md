unipd-os
========

This is the repo I use for storing college exercises, tests and trials about concurrency in ADA and Java. Most of the classes are implementations of past years tests or classroom exercises. They mostly make use of the os library, only designed for educational purposes by the course's teachers.

Please note ADA code is not supposed to actually work, and most of it is actually written in a fancy ADA-like style inside Java classes. That's an unfortunate course requirement.
